Made with vanilla javascript, html and css. This website shows the images of the different rovers sent to Mars (Curiosity, Spirit and Opportunity). 

Choose a rover, choose the Sun (Martian day) and it will show all the photos taken that sun by the selected rover. The images are requested by the NASA API. This API retrieves data from the rovers. Pay attention to the home bannerâ€¦ are they always the same images?
