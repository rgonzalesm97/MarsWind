            <h1>Curiosity</h1>
            <p>Check out the incredible photos of this Martian exploration rover that successfully landed on Mars in Gale Crater on August 6, 2012. Its main goals are to 
                determine if life ever existed on Mars, characterize the climate of Mars, determine its geology, and prepare for human exploration of Mars. In the course 
                of his mission he has taken hundreds of photos and continues to do so.</p>
            <p>Take a closer look at the red planet!</p>

            <h1>Opportunity</h1>
            <p>It landed on Mars on January 25, 2004, three weeks after its twin brother the Spirit rover. Opportunity survived multiple sandstorms and in 2011 reached 
                Endeavor Crater, which was her second landing site. Due to the 2018 dust storms on Mars, Opportunity stopped communicating on June 10 and went into hibernation 
                on June 12, 2018. It was expected to restart once the atmosphere cleared, but it did not, which suggests a catastrophic failure or that a layer of dust has 
                covered your solar panels. NASA officials stated that Opportunity's mission was completed on February 13, 2019 after failing to respond to multiple signals 
                sent out.</p>

            <h1>Spirit</h1>
            <p>The twin brother of the Opportunity rover. It landed three weeks earlier, on January 3, 2004 until May 25, 2011 when NASA officially declared the mission of the 
                robot Spirit ended, after not having received any signal from it since March 22, 2010. Spirit, has been a resounding success. Designed to survive for about 3 
                months, it landed on January 3, 2004 and worked for seven years so we have 7 years of images of this magnificent rover.</p>
